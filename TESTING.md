## Validator testing
+ ### HTML
  
    - No errors or warnings were found when passing through the official W3C validator.

    ![HTML Validator](documentation/html_validator.png)


+ ### CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official W3C (Jigsaw) validator.

  ![CSS Validator](documentation/css_validator.png)
    
    - The following warning was shown when the code was copied and validated, as line 2 contains the link to the Google Font:

  ![CSS Validator errors](documentation/css_validator_warning.png)
  
  - When the link was used to validate, no errors were shown:
  
  ![CSS Validator Link](documentation/css_validator_link.png)
  
    - 434 warnings were detected this way, all of them on line 5 (the universal selector). This has to do with the usage of Bootstrap:
    
  ![CSS Validator Link errors](documentation/css_validator_link_warnings.png)

+ ### JavaScript

- [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate JavaScript. `/* jshint esversion: 6 */` was added to ensure compatibility with ES6 (due to using module to call JavaScript files):

  - [main.js](assets/js/game.js) passed with no errors, except that bootstrap is not recognised as a defined variable:

  ![JSHint Main](documentation/jshint_main.png)

  *This could be avoided by adding ` /* global bootstrap */`*

  - [ui.js](assets/js/ui.js) passed with no errors:

  ![JSHint UI](documentation/jshint_ui.png)

  - [game.js](assets/js/game.js) passed with no errors, except that bootstrap is not recognised as a defined variable as well as the following warning:

  ![JSHint Game](documentation/jshint_game.png)

  *This could be avoided by adding ` /* global bootstrap */`*

  *Due to using `let` to define variables, this can be ignored, as `let` is block-scoped. Further, this warning is especially meant for older versions (pre-ES6)*

  - [events.js](assets/js/events.js) passed with no errors, except that bootstrap is not recognised as a defined variable:

  ![JSHint Events](documentation/jshint_events.png)

  *This could be avoided by adding ` /* global bootstrap */`*

  - [utils.js](assets/js/utils.js) passed with no errors:

  ![JSHint Utils](documentation/jshint_utils.png)

+ ## LightHouse report

    - Using lighthouse confirms the game/page performs well, follows best practices and is accessible:

## Bugs

+ ### Solved bugs

    1. On restart, the game wouldn't reset properly, throwing different errors.
    
        *Solutions:* When resetting variables, arrays, and sets, they had to be reset in the file where they were declared. Thus, the resetGame function had to be split into multiple function, all called on when the player clicks "Play Again!".
        Ensure arrays were cleared correctly to be used again.
    
    2. Event Listeners were added multiple times after restart, not allowing proper rotation of ships.
        
        *Solution:* Check for listeners already added and only add them, when there weren't any detected.

    3. Ships weren't stored properly. The chosen variables were reassigned within a loop and therefore not retaining the correct positions.
        
        *Solution:* Declared ship arrays globally and cleared them using `.length = 0`

    4. On reset, the legend/label duplicated and `.appendChild()` threw an error.

        *Solution:* Instead of clearing the div with `.innerHTML = ''`, they are made temporarily invisible until they are used again.

+ ### Unsolved bugs

    - None.
