## Validator testing
+ ### HTML
  
    - No errors or warnings were found when passing through the official W3C validator.

    ![HTML Validator](documentation/html_validator.png)


+ ### CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official W3C (Jigsaw) validator.

  ![CSS Validator](documentation/css_validator.png)
    
    - The following warning was shown, when the code was copied and validated, as line 2 contains the link to the Google Font:

  ![CSS Validator errors](documentation/css_validator_warning.png)
  
  - When the link was used to validate, no errors were shown:
  
  ![CSS Validator Link](documentation/css_validator_link.png)
  
    - 434 warnings were detected this way, all of them on line 5 (the universal selector). This has to do with the usage of Bootstrap:
    
  ![CSS Validator Link errors](documentation/css_validator_link_warnings.png)

+ ### JavaScript

- [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate JavaScript. `/* jshint esversion: 6 */` was added to ensure compatibility with ES6 (due to using module to call JavaScript files):

  - [main.js](assets/js/game.js) passed with no errors, except that bootstrap is not recognised as a defined variable:

  ![JSHint Main](documentation/jshint_main.png)

  *This could be avoided by adding ` /* global bootstrap */`*

  - [ui.js](assets/js/ui.js) passed with no errors:

  ![JSHint UI](documentation/jshint_ui.png)

  - [game.js](assets/js/game.js) passed with no errors, except that bootstrap is not recognised as a defined variable as well as the following warning:

  ![JSHint Game](documentation/jshint_game.png)

  *This could be avoided by adding ` /* global bootstrap */`*

  *Due to using `let` to define variables, this can be ignored, as `let` is block-scoped. Further, this warning is especially meant for older versions (pre-ES6)*

  - [events.js](assets/js/events.js) passed with no errors, except that bootstrap is not recognised as a defined variable:

  ![JSHint Events](documentation/jshint_events.png)

  *This could be avoided by adding ` /* global bootstrap */`*

  - [utils.js](assets/js/utils.js) passed with no errors:

  ![JSHint Utils](documentation/jshint_utils.png)

+ ## LightHouse report

    - Using lighthouse confirms the game/page performs well, follows best practices and is accessible:

## Bugs
+ ### Solved bugs
    1. The testimonials pictures had a square shape in Brave browser on a mobile phone when the border radius had been set to 50%. It was due to the outline properties settings instead of the border
    
        *Solutions:* Outline was replaced with border properties.
    
    1. The gallery image descriptions were not appearing on the picture when hovering it as the position of the .image_content was set to fixed.
        
        *Solution:* The .image_content position was set to absolute, with the top: 0, left: 0, and added padding on the .image_content. 

    1. Footer on the contact page was reducing the size of the screen and shrank the contact form as the height of the background image was set to calc(100vh-the size of the footer)
        
        *Solution:* The height of the image was set to 100hv, and the display of the footer was set to fixed.

+ ### Unsolved bugs

    - None.
